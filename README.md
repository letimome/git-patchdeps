`git-patchdeps`
===============
Tool for analyzing textual dependencies within a patch series.

Given a pile of patches, `git-patchdeps` can find out which patch modifies
which files and lines within those files. From there, it can detect that
a specific patch modifies a line introduced by an earlier patch, and
mark these patches as dependent.

This tool is intended to sort out a pile of patches, so you can
determine which patches should be applied together as a group and which
can be freely reordered without problems.

Features
--------
 - Automatically detect coarse-grained dependencies between patches
   based on the files they modify.
 - Automatically detect fine-grained dependencies between patches
   based on the lines they modify.
 - Show which patch modifies which files.
 - Output depedencies as:
    * A list
    * A textual matrix
    * A dot format graph (optionally running xdot to display it)
 - Read patches from:
    * A series of git commits (uses the git command)
    * A series of patch (diff) files

Limitations
-----------
Note that this tool can only detect textual dependencies, when two
patches touch the same line or lines close together. For logical
dependencies, where a patches applies just fine without another patch,
but does need the other to actually work, you'll still have to think
yourself :-)

Furthermore, this tool needs a proper series of patches that are known
to apply cleanly. Since it works without the original files and even
without doing the magic patch uses (offset and fuzziness) to find out
how to apply a patch, it must assume that the line numbers in the patch
are correct and works solely from that. `git-patchdeps` does do some
verification of the line contents it does have (mostly from context
lines) and will yell at you if it detects a problem, but it might not
catch these problems always...

Running git-patchdeps
---------------------
It is recommended to rename `git-patchdeps.py` to `get-patchdeps` and
place it in your `PATH`. This way it can be invoked as a `git`
subcommand.

Git-patchdeps supports a number of commandline parameters, which are
explained when running `git patchdeps --help`.

Examples
--------
This shows running patchdeps on a set of kernel cleanup patches, which
modify a single driver containing a few files. It shows both the list
output and the matrix output. In the matrix output, an `X` means the
later patch changed a line introduced by the earlier patch, while a `*`
means the later patch changes a line within two lines of a line changed
by the earlier patch (number of lines can be configured with the
`--proximity` flag).

The above uses by-line analysis. A per-file analysis is also available,
but as you can see below, it is not so useful for this example (since
there are only a handful of files in the driver, pretty much every patch
depends on every other patch:
